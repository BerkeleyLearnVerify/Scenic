    The following scenarios are equivalent except for how they specify that foo
    must be visible from ego. The size of the workspace and the visibleDistance
    of ego are chosen such that without pruning the chance of sampling a valid
    scene over 100 tries is 1-(1-(3.14*2**2)/(1e10**2))**100 = ~1e-18.
    Assuming the approximately buffered volume of the viewRegion has a 50% chance of
    rejecting (i.e. it is twice as large as the true buffered viewRegion, which testing
    indicates in this case has about a 10% increase in volume for this case), the chance
    of not finding a sample in 100 iterations is 1e-31.

    We also want to confirm that we aren't pruning too much, i.e. placing the position
    in the viewRegion instead of at any point where the object intersects the view region.
    Because of this, we want to see at least one sample where the position is outside
    the viewRegion but the object intersects the viewRegion. The chance of this happening
    per sample is ((1 / 2)**2), so by repeating the process 30 times we have
    ~1e-19 chance of not getting a single point in this zone.
