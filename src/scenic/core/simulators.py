        For details on how simulations are run, see `dynamic scenario semantics`.

        Args:
            scene (Scene): Scene from which to start the simulation (sampled using
                `Scenario.generate`).
            maxSteps (int): Maximum number of time steps for the simulation, or `None` to
                not impose a time bound.
            maxIterations (int): Maximum number of rejection sampling iterations.
            verbosity (int): If not `None`, override Scenic's global verbosity level
                (from the :option:`--verbosity` option or `scenic.setDebuggingOptions`).
            raiseGuardViolations (bool): Whether violations of preconditions/invariants
                of scenarios/behaviors should cause this method to raise an exception,
                instead of only rejecting the simulation (the default behavior).
            replay (bytes): If not `None`, must be replay data output by `Simulation.getReplay`:
                we will then replay the saved simulation rather than randomly generating
                one as usual. If **maxSteps** is larger than that of the original
                simulation, then once the replay is exhausted the simulation will continue
                to run in the usual randomized manner.
            enableReplay (bool): Whether to save data from the simulation so that it can
                be serialized for later replay using `Scenario.simulationToBytes` or
                `Simulation.getReplay`. Enabled by default as the overhead is generally low.
            enableDivergenceCheck (bool): Whether to save the values of every
                :term:`dynamic property` at each time step, so that when the simulation is
                replayed, nondeterminism in the simulator (or replaying the simulation in
                the wrong simulator) can be detected. Disabled by default as this option
                greatly increases the size of replay objects (~100 bytes per object per step).
            divergenceTolerance (float): Amount by which a dynamic property can deviate in
                a replay from its original value before we consider the replay to have
                diverged. The default value is zero: no deviation is allowed. If finer
                control over divergences is required, see `Simulation.valuesHaveDiverged`.
            continueAfterDivergence (bool): Whether to continue simulating after a
                divergence is detected instead of raising a `DivergenceError`. If this is
                true, then a divergence ends the replaying of the saved scenario but the
                simulation will continue in the usual randomized manner (i.e., it is as
                if the replay data ran out at the moment of the divergence).
            allowPickle (bool): Whether to use `pickle` to (de)serialize custom object
                types. See `sceneFromBytes` for a discussion of when this may be needed
                (rarely) and its security implications.

        Returns:
            A `Simulation` object representing the completed simulation, or `None` if no
            simulation satisfying the requirements could be found within
            **maxIterations** iterations.

        Raises:
            SimulationCreationError: if an error occurred while trying to run a
                simulation (e.g. some assumption made by the simulator was violated, like
                trying to create an object inside another).
            GuardViolation: if **raiseGuardViolations** is true and a precondition or
                invariant was violated during the simulation.
            DivergenceError: if replaying a simulation (via the **replay** option) and
                the replay has diverged from the original; requires the original simulation
                to have been run with **enableDivergenceCheck**.
            SerializationError: if writing or reading replay data fails. This could happen
                if your scenario uses an unusual custom distribution (see `sceneToBytes`)
                or if the replayed scenario has diverged without divergence-checking
                enabled.
