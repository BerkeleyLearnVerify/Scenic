    Repair is attempted via several steps, each sacrificing more accuracy

    Repair is first attempted with easy fixes, like merging vertices and fixing
    winding. These will usually not deteriorate the quality of the mesh.

    Repair is then attempted by voxelizing the mesh, filling it, and then running
    marching cubes on the mesh. This approach is somewhat accurate but always
    produces solid objects. (This is to be expected since non watertight hollow
    objects aren't well defined).
