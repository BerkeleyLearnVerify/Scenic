# Template Scenic Interface

This interface demonstrates an example template for lower-level implementation of each part of the
Scenic interface. In each of the file, `actions.py, simulator.py, model.scenic, behaviors.scenic`, we describe
what should be done to implement each class and function as well as providing simple example code to illustrate
what the function/class should contain in the docstrings. The Scenic docs has the official description for the
components of the interface, and we hope this template serves as a useful complement.
A good place to start is by examining the `simulator.py` file.
