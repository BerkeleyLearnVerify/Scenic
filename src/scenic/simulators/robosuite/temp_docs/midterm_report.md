## Example Capabilities

### 1. Probabilistic Scene Generation
```scenic
# Random object placement
cube = new Cube at (Range(-0.3, 0.3), Range(-0.3, 0.3), 0.5),
    with color Uniform((1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1))
```

### 2. Physics Simulation
```scenic
# Tower collapse scenario
for i in range(6):
    new Cylinder at (Range(-0.01, 0.01), Range(-0.01, 0.01), 0.1 + i*0.121)
terminate when (fallen cylinders) >= 3
```

### 3. Robot Integration
```scenic
robot = new PandaRobot at (0, -0.8, 0)
take SetJointPositions([0, -0.5, 0, -2.0, 0, 1.5, 0.785])
```

## Conclusion

The project has successfully established the core infrastructure for integrating Scenic with RoboSuite. The foundation is solid, with physics simulation, object creation, and basic robot control working correctly. The next phase will focus on implementing manipulation capabilities to fulfill the project's goal of enabling systematic testing of robot control policies through probabilistic scenario generation.
