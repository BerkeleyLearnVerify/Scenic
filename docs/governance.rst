Project Governance
==================

This document describes the organization and governance of the Scenic project. The key elements are as follows:


Steering Committee
------------------

The Scenic Steering Committee (SC) has responsibility for the overall governance of the Scenic project. These responsibilities include setting and revising project policies, overseeing the work of the Scenic Core Team and the Working Groups (see below), creating and phasing-out working groups, and being the final authority on changes to the Scenic language and its associated tools.

The composition of the SC has been initially fixed based on the PIs involved in Scenic's development. In 2025-2026, we plan to develop a democratic process for choosing SC members which is inclusive of the broader Scenic community, including advisors from academia, industry, and government.

Current SC members:

    * Parasara Sridhar Duggirala (UNC Chapel Hill)
    * Daniel Fremont (UC Santa Cruz)
    * Necmiye Ozay (U Michigan)
    * Sanjit Seshia (UC Berkeley)


Core Team
---------

The Scenic Core Team (CT) is a trusted core group of researchers, developers, and community members who help manage and develop the Scenic project. Currently, members of the CT are chosen by the SC.

Current CT members:
