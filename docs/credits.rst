Scenic is primarily maintained by Daniel J. Fremont.

The Scenic project was started at UC Berkeley in Sanjit Seshia's research group.

The language was initially developed by Daniel J. Fremont, Tommaso Dreossi, Shromona Ghosh, Xiangyu Yue, Alberto L. Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, and Sanjit A. Seshia.

Edward Kim assisted in developing the library for dynamic driving scenarios and putting together this documentation.

Eric Vin, Matthew Rhea, and Ellen Kalvan developed Scenic's support for 3D geometry.
Shun Kashiwa developed the auto-generated parser for Scenic 3.0 and its support for temporal requirements.

The Scenic tool and example scenarios have benefitted from additional code contributions from:
