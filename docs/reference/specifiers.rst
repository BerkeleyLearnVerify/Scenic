********************
Specifiers Reference
********************

Specifiers are used to define the properties of an object when a Scenic class is :ref:`instantiated <objectCreate>`.
This page describes all the specifiers built into Scenic, and the procedure used to :ref:`resolve <specifier resolution>` a set of specifiers into an assignment of values to properties.

Each specifier assigns values one or more properties of an object, as a function of the arguments of the specifier and possibly other properties of the object assigned by other specifiers.
For example, the :samp:`left of {X} by {Y}` specifier assigns the ``position`` property of the object being defined so that the object is a distance :samp:`{Y}` to the left of :samp:`{X}`: this requires knowing the ``width`` of the object first, so we say the ``left of`` specifier *specifies* the ``position`` property and *depends* on the ``width`` property.
In fact, the ``left of`` specifier also *optionally* specifies the ``heading`` property (to be the same as :samp:`{X}`), meaning that it assigns a value to ``heading`` if no other specifier does so: if we write :samp:`Object left of {X} by {Y}, facing {Z}`, then the new object's ``heading`` property will be determined by ``facing``, not ``left of``.
The :ref:`specifier resolution` process works out which specifier determines each property of an object, as well as an appropriate order in which to evaluate the specifiers so that dependencies have already been computed when needed.

General Specifiers
==================

.. _with {property} {value}:

with *property* *value*
-----------------------
Assigns the given property to the given value.
This is currently the only specifier available for properties other than ``position`` and ``heading``.


Position Specifiers
===================

.. _at {vector}:

at *vector*
-----------
Positions the object at the given global coordinates.

.. _offset by {vector}:

offset by *vector*
------------------
Positions the object at the given coordinates in the local coordinate system of ego (which must already be defined).

.. _offset along {direction} by {vector}:

offset along *direction* by *vector*
------------------------------------
Positions the object at the given coordinates, in a local coordinate system centered at ego and oriented along the given direction (which, if a vector field, is evaluated at ego to obtain a heading).

.. _(left | right) of {vector} [by {scalar}]:

(left | right) of *vector* [by *scalar*]
----------------------------------------
Depends on ``heading`` and ``width``. Without the optional :samp:`by {scalar}`, positions the object immediately to the left/right of the given position; i.e., so that the midpoint of the object’s right/left edge is at that position.
If :samp:`by {scalar}` is used, the object is placed further to the left/right by the given distance.

.. _(ahead of | behind) {vector} [by {scalar}]:

(ahead of | behind) *vector* [by *scalar*]
--------------------------------------------
As above, except placing the object ahead of or behind the given position (so that the midpoint of the object’s back/front edge is at that position); thereby depending on ``heading`` and ``length``.

.. _beyond {vector} by {vector} [from {vector}]:

beyond *vector* by *vector* [from *vector*]
--------------------------------------------
Positions the object at coordinates given by the second vector, in a local coordinate system centered at the first vector and oriented along the line of sight from the third vector (i.e. a heading of 0 in the local coordinate system faces directly away from the first vector).
If no third vector is provided, it is assumed to be the ego.
For example, ``beyond taxi by (0, 3)`` means 3 meters directly behind the taxi as viewed by the camera.

.. _visible [from ({Point} | {OrientedPoint})]:
.. _visible_spec:

visible [from (*Point* | *OrientedPoint*)]
------------------------------------------
Positions the object uniformly at random in the :term:`visible region` of the ego, or of the given Point/OrientedPoint if given.
More precisely, this specifier sets the ``position`` of the object being created (i.e. its center) to be a uniformly-random point in the visible region.
(This specifier is therefore slightly stricter than a requirement that the ego :sampref:`can see` the object: the specifier makes the *center* visible, while the :sampref:`can see` condition will be satisfied if the center is not visible but some other part of the object is visible.)

.. _not visible [from ({Point} | {OrientedPoint})]:

not visible [from (Point* | *OrientedPoint*)]
----------------------------------------------
Like :sampref:`visible [from ({Point} | {OrientedPoint})]` except it positions the object uniformly at random in the **non-visible** region of the ego.
Depends on ``regionContainedIn``, in order to restrict the non-visible region to the :term:`container` of the object being created, which is hopefully a bounded region (if the non-visible region is unbounded, it cannot be uniformly sampled from and an error will be raised).

.. _(in | on) {region}:

(in | on) *region*
------------------
Positions the object uniformly at random in the given `Region`.
If the Region has a :term:`preferred orientation` (a vector field), also optionally specifies ``heading`` to be equal to that orientation at the object’s ``position``.

.. _(left | right) of ({OrientedPoint} | {Object}) [by {scalar}]:

(left | right) of (*OrientedPoint* | *Object*) [by *scalar*]
------------------------------------------------------------
Positions the object to the left/right of the given `OrientedPoint`, depending on the object’s ``width``.
Also optionally specifies ``heading`` to be the same as that of the OrientedPoint.
If the OrientedPoint is in fact an `Object`, the object being constructed is positioned to the left/right of its left/right edge (i.e. the ``width`` of both objects is taken into account).

.. _(ahead of | behind) ({OrientedPoint} | {Object}) [by {scalar}]:

(ahead of | behind) (*OrientedPoint* | *Object*) [by *scalar*]
---------------------------------------------------------------
As above, except positioning the object ahead of or behind the given OrientedPoint, thereby depending on ``length``.

.. _following {vectorField} [from {vector}] for {scalar}:

following *vectorField* [from *vector* ] for *scalar*
-----------------------------------------------------
Positions the object at a point obtained by following the given vector field for the given distance starting from ego (or the position optionally provided with :samp:`from {vector}`).
Optionally specifies ``heading`` to be the heading of the vector field at the resulting point.

.. note::

  This specifier uses a forward Euler approximation of the continuous vector field.
  The choice of step size can be customized for individual fields: see the documentation
  of `VectorField`. If necessary, you can also call the underlying method
  `VectorField.followFrom`  directly.


Heading Specifiers
==================

.. _facing {heading}:

facing *heading*
----------------
Orients the object along the given heading in global coordinates.

.. _facing {vectorField}:

facing *vectorField*
--------------------
Orients the object along the given vector field at the object’s ``position``.

.. _facing (toward | away from) {vector}:

facing (toward | away from) *vector*
------------------------------------
Orients the object so that it faces toward/away from the given position (thereby depending on the object’s ``position``).

.. _apparently facing {heading} [from {vector}]:

apparently facing *heading* [from *vector*]
--------------------------------------------
Orients the object so that it has the given heading with respect to the line of sight from ego (or the ``from`` vector).
For example, ``apparently facing 90 deg`` orients the object so that the camera views its left side head-on.

.. _specifier resolution:

Specifier Resolution
====================

Specifier resolution is the process of determining, given the set of specifiers used to define an object, which properties each specifier should determine and what order to evaluate the specifiers in.
As each specifier can specify multiple properties, both non-optionally and optionally, and can depend on the results of other specifiers, this process is somewhat non-trivial.
Assuming there are no cyclic dependencies or conflicts, the process will conclude with each property being determined by its unique non-optional specifier if one exists; otherwise its unique optional specifier if one exists; or finally by its default value if no specifiers apply at all (with default values from subclasses overriding those in superclasses).

The full procedure, given a set of specifiers *S* used to define an instance of class *C*, works as follows:

1. If a property is specified non-optionally by mutiple specifiers in *S*, an ambiguity error is raised.
2. The set of properties *P* for the new object is found by combining the properties specified by all members of *S* with the properties inherited from the class *C*.
3. Default value specifiers from *C* (or if not overridden, from its superclasses) are added to *S* as needed so that each property in *P* is paired with a unique specifier in *S* specifying it, using the following precedence order: non-optional specifier, optional specifier, then default value.
4. The dependency graph of the specifiers *S* is constructed. If it is cyclic, an error is raised.
5. The graph is topologically sorted and the specifiers are evaluated in this order to determine the values of all properties *P* of the new object.
