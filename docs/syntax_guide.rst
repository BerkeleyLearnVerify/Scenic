Objects
-------

The syntax :sampref:`{class} {specifier}, {...} <objectCreate>` creates an instance of a Scenic class.

The Scenic class `Point` provides the basic position properties in the first table below; its subclass `OrientedPoint` adds the orientation properties in the second table.
Finally, the class `Object`, which represents physical objects and is the default superclass of user-defined Scenic classes, adds the properties in the third table.
See the :ref:`objects_and_classes` for details.

   **Property**       **Default**                    **Meaning**
-------------------  --------------  ------------------------------------------------
 position [1]_        (0, 0)         position in global coordinates
 viewDistance          50            distance for the ‘can see’ operator
 mutationScale         0             overall scale of :ref:`mutations <mutate>`
 positionStdDev        1             mutation standard deviation for ``position``
===================  ==============  ================================================
