Publications Using VerifAI
==========================

Main Papers
-----------

The main paper on VerifAI is:

	Dreossi*, Fremont*, Ghosh*, Kim, Ravanbakhsh, Vazquez-Chanlatte, and Seshia, :t:`VerifAI: A Toolkit for the Formal Design and Analysis of Artificial Intelligence-Based Systems`, `CAV 2019 <https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sseshia/pubs/b2hd-verifai-cav19.html>`_.

The Scenic environment modeling language is described in another paper (see the `Scenic documentation <https://scenic-lang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/publications.html>`_ for the most recent bibliography):

	Fremont, Dreossi, Ghosh, Yue, Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, and Seshia, :t:`Scenic: A Language for Scenario Specification and Scene Generation`, PLDI 2019. [`full version <https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09310>`_]

\* Equal contribution.

Case Studies
------------

We have also used VerifAI in several industrial case studies:

	Fremont, Chiu, Margineantu, Osipychev, and Seshia, :t:`Formal Analysis and Redesign of a Neural Network-Based Aircraft Taxiing System with VerifAI`, CAV 2020 (to appear). [`arXiv preprint <https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07173>`__]

	Fremont, Kim, Pant, Seshia, Acharya, Bruso, Wells, Lemke, Lu, and Mehta, :t:`Formal Scenario-Based Testing of Autonomous Vehicles: From Simulation to the Real World`, ITSC 2020 (to appear). [`arXiv preprint <https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07739>`__]
