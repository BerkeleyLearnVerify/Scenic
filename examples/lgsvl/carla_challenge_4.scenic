# Traffic Scenario 04: Obstacle avoidance with prior action
# Definition: While performing a maneuver, the ego-vehicle finds an obstacle / unexpected entity on the road and must perform an emergency brake or an avoidance maneuver. 
# ego at intersection where a maneuver is available, ego takes any turn. obstacle is stationary according to sheets... but i want it to move
