# Traffic Scenario 07: Crossing traffic running a red light at an intersection
# Definition: Ego-vehicle is going straight at an intersection but a crossing vehicle runs a red light, forcing the ego-vehicle to perform a collision avoidance maneuver.

# old pseudocode -
# intersection = Uniform(*network.intersections)
# require (len(intersection.incomingLanes) == 4) # requires 4-way intersection
# lane1 = Uniform(*intersection.incomingLanes)
# lane2 = Uniform(*intersection.incomingLanes) 
# require (lane1 is not lane2)

# traffic lights not implemented, but if they were: red light across from actor, green across from ego.


# NOTES

# actor car sometimes in a position where there's no conflicting moves. make sure actor isn't in adjacent lane. 
# actor has brake on sometimes ?
