""" Scenario Description
Traffic Scenario 03 (static).
Obstacle avoidance without prior action.
The ego-vehicle encounters an obstacle / unexpected entity on the road and must perform an
emergency brake or an avoidance maneuver.

To run this file using the Carla simulator:

## DEFINING BEHAVIORS

## DEFINING SPATIAL RELATIONS
# Please refer to scenic/domains/driving/roads.py how to access detailed road infrastructure
# 'network' is the 'class Network' object in roads.py

# make sure to put '*' to uniformly randomly select from all elements of the list, 'lanes'
