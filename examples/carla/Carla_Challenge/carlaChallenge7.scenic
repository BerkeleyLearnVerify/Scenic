""" Scenario Description
Based on 2019 Carla Challenge Traffic Scenario 07.
Ego-vehicle is going straight at an intersection but a crossing vehicle 
runs a red light, forcing the ego-vehicle to perform a collision avoidance maneuver.
Note: The traffic light control is not implemented yet, but it will soon be.
